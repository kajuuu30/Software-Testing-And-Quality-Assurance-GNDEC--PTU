## Practical 
1. To Prepare Test Plan for the implemented system under test. The Test Plan shall be based onSystem Requirement Specification. The Test plan consists of following issues.
  a. Purpose of the test. /Location and schedule of the test.
  b. Test descriptions. /Pass and Fail Criteria.

2. To identify and narrate Test cases, Test scripts/procedures and Test incident report identifier for the system under test. Refer Use case analysis document to prepare mentioned/ identified test documents.

3. To perform Unit testing especially indicating the traced Independent data paths, control paths and Error handling paths. Prepare control flow graphs for the unit under test. Compute the cyclomatic complexity of the unit.

4. To perform Data Flow testing for the Program Segments by identifying the Definition-Use chainand type of data flow anomaly.

5. To perform Mutation Analysis of the Program Segments along with mutant history, mutation score and type of mutation by using any Code analysis Tool / Mutation Testing Tool.

6. To perform Black-Box Testing for all the units contained in the architectural segments using Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis and Orthogonal Array testing methods. Study xploratory Testing for the Module under Test and merits/demerits of this technique.

7. To perform Regression Testing of the System under construction with Unit and Integration profiles by using any Functional Testing Tool.
